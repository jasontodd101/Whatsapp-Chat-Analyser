# Whatsapp-Chat-Analyser
A WhatsApp chat analyzer made with Streamlit is a tool that allows you to analyze your WhatsApp chats in various ways, using an interactive web interface. Streamlit is a Python framework that makes it easy to build interactive data applications.

The WhatsApp chat analyzer can perform various analyses on your chat history, such as:

Word frequency: Shows you the most commonly used words in the chat, so you can identify the topics that are most frequently discussed.

Message frequency: Shows you the number of messages sent by each person in the chat, so you can see who is the most active participant.

Sentiment analysis: Analyzes the sentiment of each message and gives you an overall sentiment score for the chat, so you can see whether the chat is generally positive or negative.

Time analysis: Shows you the frequency of messages sent at different times of the day, so you can see when the chat is most active.

To build a WhatsApp chat analyzer with Streamlit, you would first need to extract the chat data from your WhatsApp account. This can be done by exporting your chat history as a text file. Once you have the chat data in a text file, you can use Python to read and analyze the data.

You can use Streamlit to create an interactive web interface that allows users to upload their chat data file and choose the type of analysis they want to perform. The interface should display the results of the analysis in a user-friendly way, such as graphs or tables.

Overall, a WhatsApp chat analyzer made with Streamlit can provide valuable insights into your chat history and help you understand your communication patterns with your friends and family.
